# Phonetix

Data is scraped from a an open sourced collection of IPA phonetical sounds pronounced while being visually captured by an MRI machine. The data is part of the Seeing Speech web resource collected collected at the University of Glasgow $^{[1]}$.

**Potential limitations** include biasing the model to the speaker's unique annunciations. Moreover, it should not scale to cases where dental or mouth medical accessories (or mouth deformaties) are introduced.

**Goal** develop live inner-mouth visualization to aid in the learning of particular annuciations, and allow learners to visually reflect and review differences between their annunciation and that of an expert linguist/orator.
